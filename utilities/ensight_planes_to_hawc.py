# Script to convert "array" sampling planes from SOWFA (written in
# Ensight format) and into a FAST turbulence box (written in binary
# HAWC full-field file format)
#
# Written by Eliot Quon (eliot.quon@nrel.gov)
#
# SAMPLE USAGE:
# To process ./*/inflowPlane_03km_U.000.U:
#   ensight_planes_to_hawc.py 'inflowPlane_03km_U'
#
# Note: Alternative values for reference velocity and height (uref
# and zref) may be specified but should not be modify the velocity
# field. They are subtracted out by the this script only to be added
# back on by FAST (based on what is specified in the InflowWind input
# file).
